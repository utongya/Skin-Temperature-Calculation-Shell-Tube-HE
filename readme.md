# Shell & Tube Heat Exchanger Skin Temperature Calculator

This web application calculates the skin temperature, heat flux, tube flow velocity, and total tube surface area for a shell & tube heat exchanger. It also provides stress level indicators for each calculated value.

## Features

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - Heat Duty (kW)  
  - Flow Rate (m³/hr)  
  - CW Inlet Temp (°C)  
  - CW Outlet Temp (°C)  
  - Tube ID (m)  
  - Tube Length (m)  
  - Total Tubes  
  - No. Tube Passes  
  - Configuration (Co-Current / Counter-Current)

- **Calculation Results:**  
  - Total Tube Surface Area  
  - Heat Flux  
  - Tube Flow Velocity  
  - Tube Skin Temperature  
  - Stress level badges for each result

- **Validation:**  
  - Checks for valid, positive inputs  
  - Ensures total tubes is divisible by tube passes  
  - Displays error messages for invalid input.
